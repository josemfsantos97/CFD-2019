This repository contains the code and breef explanation regarding the group homework assignments for the course CDF at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

## [Homework 1 - Finite Differences and Finite Volume Methods](https://github.com/josemfsantos97/CFD-2019/tree/main/Homework01)
- Understanding error sources and decay for Finite Differences approximations.
- Solving the linearized potential flow equations using the small perturbations approach for three different flow regimes: subsonic, supersonic and transonic.

## [Homework 2 - Convection Schemes and Heat Transfer in Unstructured Grid](https://github.com/josemfsantos97/CFD-2019/tree/main/Homework02)
- Solving a 1D advection equation using the finite volume method with periodic boundaries with different schemes. 
- Different spatial schemes, explicit time schemes implicit time schems with different orders of accuracy. Furthermore, one flux limiter is tested. Stability conditions are derived and plotted in the polar diagram, as well as dispersive and diffusive errors.
- Understanding sources of error due to non-uniform grids. Solving the Laplace Equation with different types of non-uniform grid (triangular, prism layer and polyhedral).
